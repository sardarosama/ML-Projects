Welcome to my machine learning repository!

This repository contains a variety of machine learning projects that I have worked on. The projects in this repository cover a range of topics, including supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.

Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations, as well as a separate file containing the dataset used for the project.

I hope you find these projects informative and useful. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my repository!
